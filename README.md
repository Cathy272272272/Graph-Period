# Graph-Period
For an irreducible (strongly connected) graph G we can calculate itsperiod as follows:IPerform a depth-first search of GIFor each e in G that connects a vertex on level i of the depth-firstsearch tree to a vertex on level j, letke=j−i−1.ICompute the greatest common divisor of the set of numberske
